# WowOpenBox

Open source, non commercial use software for MultiBoxing World of Warcraft within the rules.

## Installation

Get Tcl/Tk for windows with twapi

https://www.magicsplat.com/tcl-installer/index.html#downloads

Get this file [wowopenbox.tkapp](wowopenbox.tkapp) and run (double click to launch)

Then start your world of warcraft clients (Classic or Shadowlands) using launcher is fine (that way you don't need to keep typing your password) and in "Windowed (Fullscreen)" mode, so they don't have a title or border and can be neatly arranged by WowOpenBox!
