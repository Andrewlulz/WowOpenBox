## Installation

WowOpenBox is optimized for Microsoft Windows 10.

We will eventually have an all in one installer but for now you need to get Tcl/Tk for windows with twapi first (one time thing, not needed to get newer WOB updates later):

Then get this application using a [release](https://github.com/WowOpenBox/WowOpenBox/releases) zip, or the latest zip:

https://github.com/WowOpenBox/WowOpenBox/archive/main.zip 

Extract all (unzip) to your folder of choice and run it: double click `WowOpenBox.tkapp` to launch.

Then start your world of warcraft clients (Classic or Shadowlands) using launcher is fine (that way you don't need to keep typing your password) and in "Windowed (Fullscreen)" mode, so they don't have a title or border and can be neatly arranged by WowOpenBox!
